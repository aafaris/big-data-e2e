# End-to-End (E2E) Big Data Application for Autonomous Driving Data
This project aims to resolve shortcomings in data storage and management aspects by introducing a unified infrastructure to support storage of autonomous driving data where engineers are able to use, manage and transfer data in a controlled and efficient manner. This includes ETL data pipeline, improving data accessibility, creating data understanding and data visualisations.
